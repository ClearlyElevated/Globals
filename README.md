## Description
Globals is a social chat bot for Discord, bringing multiple Discord communities together. You can enable or disable specific global channels, depending on your need. For instance, if you have a Rainbow 6: Siege community, you can enable only the Rainbow 6 channel. This allows you to communicate with other communities with the same interests.
