## About Globals
Global Bot aims to bring different communities closer. Global chats are a good way to find new team mates, people to play against or good to chat with new people.

## Inviting Global Bot
- Start by inviting the bot to your server, just like any other bot. 
  (https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591434736514367508&scope=bot&permissions=1611132113)
- Run the `!setup` command, this will add the server to the database.
- Run the `!enable` command, this will show you which channels are enabled. Use `!enable <channelname> <true|false>` to toggle the channels.
- Run the `!create` command, this will create a category titled 'globals' and create the enabled channels inside the category. You can move the channels freely around the server.
- Messages inside the global chats, that aren't commands, will be posted to all other servers using the same channel.

## Global Chat Moderation
- Anti flood features
- Profanity filters
- Moderation commands for 'Global Moderators'
- Warning and Blacklist system
- And more!

## DISCORD HACK WEEK REVIEW TEAM READ BELOW!
In order for you to test Globals fully, you will need to be in atleast two servers with the bot invited. We haven't really made it to be self hosted, as it needs multiple servers using the same bot. You can obviously use the Globals server with your testing (https://discord.gg/kgjZaNt). Any questions? Feel free to ask me @Blurr#3760 or ask for me in a global channel! This is a bot that benefits when there are more servers and more people using it. A week is a short time for building the population, but I hope you like what you see!

So what exactly does Globals do and what is this concept about? This is Version 1, proof of concept. Bringing multiple Discord communities together with globally viewable channels. As I said, this is proof on concept, so I will go into more detail with what my plans are with the future of Globals. Once Version 1 is up and running, should be by the 28th June of course. I will have different variations, for example 'Rainbow 6: Siege Globals'. This allows for each of the variations to be more specific and suit servers better. Instead of 'general' chats, they could have chats that are specific to the game. Carrying on the example with Rainbow 6, there could be channels for 'Looking to play ranked', 'Looking for a team', 'Looking for team to scrim' and more. Each obviously can be enabled or disabled on each server. This would of been extremely helpful, back when I played with a team on Siege. We would always have an issue finding other teams to scrim against, and more. Even once the other variaties are up, I plan on keeping this version up. As the main variation, the general chats.

## Post Hack Week Plans
- Store the Globals category id in the servers database. A more reliable way to find the category than by searching for the category called "globals".
- Add more checks to prevent errors.
- Rewrite some of the "check channel" code. Everything is currently hard coded but shouldn't be as this makes it harder to add new channels. This will be one of the first things to do after Hack Week. Wish I had the time to do it during hack week but I do not :(.
- Optimize the MySql Queries.
- Move the hosting over to the server pc.
If you have any suggestions or feedback (no matter how harsh) when reviewing our Hack Week submission, a message on Discord or if you open an 'issue' here on github, I would massively appreciate it.
